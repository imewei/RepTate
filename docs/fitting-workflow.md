# Fitting Workflow

## Deterministic Fit

1. Import a dataset using the supported formats.
2. Choose a model and configure parameter bounds.
3. Run the deterministic fit to obtain parameters and diagnostics.

## Uncertainty Workflow

1. Use deterministic fit outputs as warm starts.
2. Run the uncertainty workflow to obtain summaries and prediction bands.
3. Review diagnostics for convergence and stability.

## Outputs

- Structured data export for fit and uncertainty results.
- Human-readable summary for reporting and review.
